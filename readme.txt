Convert WordPress to static HTML. Boost performance 3-5x. Eliminate security vulnerabilities. Deploy anywhere.

== Description ==
Simply Static turns your WordPress site into secure, lightning-fast static HTML files.

Stop worrying about WordPress security patches, performance plugins, and expensive hosting.

= Plugins & Features That Don't Work with Static Sites =
Static sites are perfect for public content, but some WordPress plugins require server-side processing and won't work on static sites:

**E-commerce:**

* WooCommerce
* Easy Digital Downloads
* Other shopping cart plugins

Static sites can't process payments or manage user accounts. Consider headless WordPress solutions for e-commerce.

**Membership & Authentication:**

* MemberPress
* Restrict Content Pro
* User registration plugins
* Login-required content

Static sites don't support user authentication or member-only areas.

**Real-Time Dynamic Content:**

* Forum plugins (bbPress, BuddyPress)
* Live chat widgets (unless using external services)
* Real-time data feeds
* Heavy AJAX functionality

**What DOES Work (with Pro/Studio):**

* Forms (Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, WPForms, Fluent Forms)
* Search functionality (Fuse.js or Algolia)
* Comments (special integration)
* Newsletter signups (via external services)

If your site relies heavily on the plugins listed above, Simply Static may not be the right solution. For questions about specific plugin compatibility, check our compatibility database or ask in our support forum.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is Simply Static really free? =
Yes! The core plugin is 100% free and open source. It provides everything you need for basic static site generation and ZIP export.
Simply Static Pro and Studio are optional premium products for advanced features like automated deployment, forms, search, and managed hosting.
= What's the difference between the free plugin, Pro, and Studio? =
Free: Generate static sites, export as ZIP or to local directory. Perfect for testing and simple exports.
Pro ($99-299/year): Advanced deployment, automation, forms, search, WP-CLI. For developers and agencies self-hosting.
Studio (from $9/month): All-in-one managed hosting. We handle WordPress, static hosting, backups, SSL, everything. For businesses who want zero maintenance.
See detailed comparison
= Can I use the free version for production sites? =
Yes, but you'll need to manually upload the ZIP file to your hosting provider each time you update your site.
For production sites with frequent updates, we recommend Pro (automated deployments) or Studio (fully managed).
= Will my site look different after going static? =
No. Simply Static creates an exact copy of your WordPress site. Same HTML, same CSS, same JavaScript. The only difference is it loads faster and is more secure.
= Do I need to know how to code? =
No. Simply Static works through a simple WordPress admin interface. Click a button, get your static site.
Developers can extend Simply Static with 100+ hooks and filters, but coding knowledge is not required for basic use.
= Can I still use WordPress after generating a static site? =
Yes! Your WordPress site remains fully functional. You use WordPress to manage content, then generate a new static version when you're ready to publish updates.
= What happens to forms, search, and comments on my static site? =
With the free version, these features won't work on your static site (they require server-side processing).
Simply Static Pro and Studio add working forms, search, and comments to your static site using smart integrations.
= Can I host my static site for free? =
Yes! Deploy your static site to:

Cloudflare Pages (free)
GitHub Pages (free)
Netlify (free tier)
Vercel (free tier)

Or host on any traditional web host or CDN for very low cost.
= Does Simply Static work with my theme/plugins? =
Simply Static works with virtually all WordPress themes and most plugins.
Confirmed compatible themes: Virtually all (including block themes)
Page builders: Elementor, Bricks, Gutenberg, Beaver Builder, Divi
SEO plugins: Yoast SEO, Rank Math, AIOSEO, SEOPress
Form plugins: Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, WPForms (forms work with Pro/Studio)
See full compatibility list
= How is this different from caching plugins? =
Caching plugins make your WordPress site faster, but your WordPress installation remains accessible and vulnerable.
Simply Static creates a completely separate static copy that serves no PHP, has no database, and can't be hacked. Your WordPress installation stays private and secure.
= Can I use Simply Static with Elementor/Gutenberg/other builders? =
Yes! Simply Static works with all major page builders including Elementor, Elementor Pro, Bricks, Gutenberg, Beaver Builder, Divi, and more.
= What about SEO? =
Static sites are excellent for SEO. Faster load times = better rankings.
Simply Static maintains all your SEO metadata, sitemaps, and schema markup. It works seamlessly with Yoast SEO, Rank Math, AIOSEO, and SEOPress.
= Can I run a multilingual site? =
Yes, with Simply Static Pro or Studio. Full support for WPML, Polylang, and TranslatePress.
The free version can generate static sites in multiple languages, but managing separate exports per language is easier with Pro.
= Will this work on WordPress.com? =
Simply Static requires the ability to install plugins. It works on:

Self-hosted WordPress (wordpress.org)
WordPress.com Business plan or higher
Most shared hosting providers
VPS and dedicated servers

= How big of a site can Simply Static handle? =
Simply Static has successfully generated static sites with 100,000+ pages. Site size is generally limited by your server's resources (memory, execution time).
